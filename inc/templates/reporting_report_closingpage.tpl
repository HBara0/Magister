        <p style="text-align: justify; padding: 5px 50px;">
            Dear Business Partner,
            <br />
            <br />
            We wish to alert you to the fact that Orkila has been experiencing an increasing number of fraudulent e.mails in recent days.
            <br />
            <br />
            The messages are designed to look identical to a legitimate message that a user might receive from a trusted source. We would like to warn you about these emails, and to assure you that they do not originate from Orkila, nor from any of its partners.
            <br />
            <br />
            Usually, an e.mail, carrying an email address which looks authentic, is used to inform the supplier or customer that Orkila has changed its bank account details, and that all future bank transfers should be made to the new bank account; which belongs to the fraudster. <br /><u><strong>Please be aware that Orkila has not changed its bank details</strong></u>. In the event that Orkila does make a change to its banking arrangements, you will always receive a phone call beforehand and this call will then be followed by a confirming e.mail. Orkila will never send such an e.mail unannounced or in isolation. If you do receive such an e.mail, we urge you, most strongly, to contact Orkila without delay, and before making any payment.
        <br />
        <br />
        These emails are fake and fraudulent. They are not Orkila branded, do not include the usual Orkila identification elements and do not originate from our company. If you receive any suspicious e-mails containing instructions purporting to come from Orkila, please do not comply with them but contact your usual Orkila contact.
        <br />
        <br />
        If you have any comments or questions relating to the above, please contact:<br />
